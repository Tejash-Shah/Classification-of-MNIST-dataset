Various classification algorithms are be applied to understand the math, statistics and working behind the algorithms. 

Algorithms are compared not only on the basis on Accuracy but also using numerous factors such as Precision, recall, F-1 score, test error and time to fit the model.

In addition to applying algorithms, various feature reduction techniques like Principal Component Analysis and Singular-value decomposition has been applied to see the impact on accuracy.
